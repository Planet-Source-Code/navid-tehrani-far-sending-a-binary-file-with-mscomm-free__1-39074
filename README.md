### Source Code

There is an application named BASE64 ENCODER\DECODER. You can download it from anywhere because that is a popular one. There are a lot of versions written by a lot of companies and you can download it free. This program can convert Binary files to ASCII files. That makes it easy for MSCOMM to transmit the file.
